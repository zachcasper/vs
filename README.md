# Radius 

This tutorial is based on the staged [Create a Resource Type in Radius](https://red-sea-07f97dc1e-1409.westus2.3.azurestaticapps.net/tutorials/tutorial-resource-type/) tutorial. The only difference between that tutorial and this one is the inclusion of using an Azure Database for PostgreSQL resource and the ability to specify the database name.

## Prerequisites

1. Radius CLI at least version 0.46 installed on the workstation
1. Node.js installed on the workstation
1. An AKS cluster
1. A Git repository for storing the Terraform configurations; this tutorial will assumes anonymous access to the Git repository, if that is not the case see [this documentation](https://red-sea-07f97dc1e-1409.westus2.3.azurestaticapps.net/guides/recipes/terraform/howto-private-registry/)

## Install Radius on AKS
This tutorial will set up two environments: dev and test. The dev environment will use recipes which deploy all resources to the Kubernetes cluster. The test environment will deploy containers to Kubernetes and other resources, such as databases, to Azure.

### Build the air-gapped Radius 
Clone the Radius repository.
```
git clone git@github.com:radius-project/radius.git
```
Check out the air-happed-cluster branch
```
git checkout ytimocin/air-gapped-cluster
```
Build the custom binary.
```
make install
```

### Setup Azure variables

Set some variables for your Azure subscription and resource group.
```
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=
export AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=
expost AZURE_LOCATION=
export AKS_CLUSTER_NAME=
```
Get the kubecontext for your AKS cluster if it's not already set.
```
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME
```
### Install Radius.
Set the environment variables.
```
export RADIUS_CHART=
export REGISTRY_HOST=
export RADIUS_VERSION=
```
Install Radius.
```
rad install kubernetes \
  --chart ${RADIUS_CHART} \
  --set rp.image=${REGISTRY_HOST}/radius-project/applications-rp,rp.tag=${RADIUS_VERSION} \
  --set dynamicrp.image=${REGISTRY_HOST}/radius-project/dynamic-rp,dynamicrp.tag=${RADIUS_VERSION} \
  --set controller.image=${REGISTRY_HOST}/radius-project/controller,controller.tag=${RADIUS_VERSION} \
  --set ucp.image=${REGISTRY_HOST}/radius-project/ucpd,ucp.tag=${RADIUS_VERSION} \
  --set bicep.image=${REGISTRY_HOST}/radius-project/bicep,bicep.tag=${RADIUS_VERSION} \
  --set de.image=${REGISTRY_HOST}/radius-project/deployment-engine,de.tag=${RADIUS_VERSION} \
  --set dashboard.image=${REGISTRY_HOST}/radius-project/dashboard,dashboard.tag=${RADIUS_VERSION}
```

### Create the dev environment
All resources including Radius environments reside in a resource group just like in Azure. Since we will be deploying the same application to a dev and a test environment, we need two separate resource groups (unless we wanted to rename our application but that defeats the purpose).

Create a resource group for the dev environment.
```
rad group create dev
```
Create a dev environment in the dev resource group.
```
rad environment create dev --group dev
```
Set up the Radius CLI configuration file. Radius uses the term workspace to refer to a specific combination of Radius installation, environment, and group.
```
rad workspace create kubernetes dev --context $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --environment dev --group dev
```
### Create the test environment
Create a resource group for the test environment.
```
rad group create test
```
Create a test environment in the test resource group.
```
rad environment create test --group test
```
Set the Radius CLI configuration file. Radius uses the term workspace to refer to a specific combination of Radius installation, environment, and group.
```
rad workspace create kubernetes test --context $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --environment test --group test
```
### Setup Azure authentication
In order for Radius to deploy resources to Azure, it must be able to authenticate. Radius itself must be authenticated to Azure even if you are authenticated on your local workstation. If Radius is not authenticated and you run `rad deploy`, the deployment will fail. Radius can authenticate to Azure using either a [service principal](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/operations/providers/azure-provider/howto-azure-provider-sp/) or if [workload identity](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/operations/providers/azure-provider/howto-azure-provider-wi/) is set up. This tutorial assumes a service principal.

Create a service principal if you do not already have one and set environment variables.
```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role Owner --scope /subscriptions/$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME > /tmp/sp.json
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=`jq -r .'appId' /tmp/sp.json`
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=`jq -r .'password' /tmp/sp.json`
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=`jq -r .'tenant' /tmp/sp.json`
rm /tmp/sp.json
```
Add the service principal as a credential in Radius. Credentials today are stored at the Radius top level. In the future, we plan to move credentials to the environment level to enable multiple subscriptions.
```
rad credential register azure sp --client-id $AZURE_CLIENT_ID  --client-secret $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET --tenant-id $AZURE_TENANT_ID
```
Update the dev and test environments with the Azure details.
```
rad environment update dev \
  --workspace dev \
  --azure-subscription-id $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  --azure-resource-group $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
rad environment update test \
  --workspace test \
  --azure-subscription-id $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
  --azure-resource-group $AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME
```

## Create PostgreSQL resource type

```
rad resource-type create postgreSQL -f types.yaml
```

## Register the PostgreSQL recipe

Commit the recipes directory into a Git repository. This directory has two Terraform recipes for deploying a PostgreSQL database, one for Kubernetes and one for Azure. The Kubernetes recipe will be used for the dev environment while the Azure recipe will be used for the test environment.

### Dev environment

Register the Kubernetes recipe in the dev environment.
```
rad recipe register default \
  --workspace dev \
  --resource-type Radius.Resources/postgreSQL \
  --template-kind terraform \
  --template-path git::https://github.com/zachcasper/ubs.git//recipes/kubernetes/postgresql
```
Some explaination of this command is warranted. 

* `rad recipe register` – This is creating a pointer to a Terraform configuration or a Bicep template which will be called when a resource is created in Radius.
* `rad recipe register default` – Each recipe has a name but you should use default. This is legacy functionality which will be retired. With older resource types which are built into Radius such as Redis and MongoDB, developers could specify a named recipe to be used to deploy the resource. The newer resource types such as the PostgreSQL resource type we are defining here will not allow developers to specify a recipe name. 
* `--template-path git::https://github.com/zachcasper/ubs.git//recipes/kubernetes/postgresql` – This is the path to the Terraform configuration. Radius uses the generic Git module source as [documented here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/sources#generic-git-repository). In the example here, the Git repository on GitHub is UBS. The `//` indicates a sub-module or a sub-directory and postgresql is the directory containing the main.tf file.

### Test environment

Register the Azure recipe in the test environment.
```
rad recipe register default \
  --workspace test \
  --resource-type Radius.Resources/postgreSQL \
  --template-kind terraform \
  --template-path git::https://github.com/zachcasper/ubs.git//recipes/azure/postgresql \
  --parameters resource_group_name=$AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --parameters location=$AZURE_LOCATION
```
Notice that there are parameters on this recipe which were not on the dev environments. We encountered a bug where Radius was not setting the resource group or location on the context variable which gets past to the recipe. The parameters arguement forces a variable to be set in the Terraform configuration. You'll see this variable referenced in the azure/postgresql/main.tf on line 34 and 35 (var.resource_group_name and var.location). In the future these variables would be var.context.azure.resourceGroup and the parameter will not be required.

## Create the Bicep extension

Since we created a new resource type, we must tell Bicep how to handle it. This is performed by creating a Bicep extension. Bicep extensions can be stored in either Azure Container Registry or on the file system. This example will use the file system. The documentation for using a private module registry is [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/quickstart-private-module-registry?tabs=azure-cli).

Create the Bicep extension.
```
rad bicep publish-extension -f types.yaml --target radiusResources.tgz
```
Update the bicepconfig.json file to include the extension. The bicepconfig.json included in this example has already been updated. Consult the documentation on having multiple bicepconfig.json files if you are interested. Note that when you when your bicepconfig.json file is stored in a different directory than your .tgz extension file, you must reference the extension file using the full path name, not a relative path.

## Deploy the todolist application to dev
Make sure you are using the dev environment.
```
rad workspace switch dev
```
Deploy the todolist application.
```
rad deploy todolist.bicep
```
### Port forward and open the application
Use kubectl to port forward the frontend pod. Typically in a shared environment, the container would have a gateway resource which would setup an ingress controller using Contour. Since we installed Radius without Contour, the gateway resource will not work. 
```
kubectl port-forward `kubectl get pods -n dev-todolist | grep frontend | awk '{print $1}'` 3000:3000 -n dev-todolist
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Click the POSTGRESQL environment variable and examine the environment variables injected into the container.

We could have also used `rad run todolist.bicep -a todolist` which would have setup port forwarding automatically.

### Examine the resources deployed
Run the rap app graph command and confirm that Radius has created Kubernetes resources for the PostgreSQL database.
```
rad app graph -a todolist
```

## Deploy the todolist application to test
Switch to the test enviornment
```
rad workspace switch test
```
Deploy the todolist application.
```
rad deploy todolist.bicep
```
### Port forward and open the application
Use the same kubectl port-forward command as before, but change the namespace from dev-todolist to test-todolist. 

### Examine the resources deployed
Use the same `rap app graph -a todolist` command and confirm that Radius has created the PostgreSQL database on Azure.

## Clean up
Delete both applications.
```
rad app delete --workspace dev
rad app delete --workspace test
```
Verify the pods are terminated on the Kubernetes cluster.
```
kubectl get pods -A
```
Delete the namespaces if the pods still exist. This is not expected but just to make sure. When you delete the application the namespaces are retained but the pods should be destroyed. 
```
kubectl delete namespace dev-todolist
kubectl delete namespace test-todolist
```
Verify the Azure PostgreSQL database has been deleted via the Azure portal. This is not expected just to make sure.

Optionally, delete the Radius environments, Radius resource groups, and associated workspaces.
```
rad environment delete dev
rad group delete dev
rad workspace delete dev
rad environment delete test
rad group delete test
rad workspace delete test
```
Optionally, delete the postgreSQL resource type.
```
rad delete resource-type Radius.Resources/postgreSQL
```
